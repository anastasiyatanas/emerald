                            I know you are in school and also works so I know that you dont have much time to eat a healthy lunch. Also you wake up really early and dont have time to prepare a health breakfast or lunch. I would recommend preparing a breakfast or lunch the night before you have to wake up early. I also know that you dont do the shopping in your house. What I would recommend is going to the store and buying some vegetables and fruits as often as you can in order to have them in the house, it’s easier to grab something healthy when its already there. If you can’t make it to the store, you can always ask your mom to pick up some fruits or more vegetables for you, I’m sure your mom wouldn’t mind. Even if you dont have time to take a lunch, I would recommend going and buying something thats more healthy and has more to offer nutrition wise, like buying a grilled chicken wrap with veggies in it. I know you love Chick-Fil-A and I know they have a great wrap, along with fruit cups. The fruits and vegetables would help you with your vitamins and minerals.
